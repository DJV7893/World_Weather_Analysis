## Overview:
---
  For one of the top traveling companies, we created a travel app for customers using an assortment of weather data for 600 plus cities in order to recommend ideal hotels based on their weather prefereneces. The app allowed users to input their prefered temperature range and once they've filtered the database based on their temperature preferences a heatmap will be shown for the maximum temperature for the filtered cities. In addition, a marker for each city was displayed for the name of the city, country code, maximum temperature, and name of a nearby hotel within three miles of the coordinates when the marker is clicked. 
  
  After completing the initial app for beta users, we have been given recommendations to improve the weather app. They haved asked us to add the weather description to the weather data weâ€™ve already retrieved. Then, we'll have the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, we will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
